1. Implicit type casting -->

a] Priority in implicit type casting (less to high priority) ==> bool --> char --> short int --> int --> unsigned int --> long --> unsigned long --> long long --> unsigned long long --> float --> double --> long double
b] Data loss happens when Type is converted from High priority type to Low priority type
c] No data loss happens when Type is converted from Low priority type to High priority type


2. Explicit type casting -->

a] C style type casting
b] function style type casting
c] static type casting
d] dynamic type casting
e] const type casting
f] reinterpret type casting
